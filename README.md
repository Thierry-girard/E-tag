# E-tag

The E-tag project is a small Unity prototype for Hololens. This application enables the user to paint on the Spatial Mapping mesh generated by the Hololens using his hand. Th difference here is that the paint spray will follow the user's hand and not the Hololen's cursor. 

A particle system is used to generate quads on each collision with a mesh, applying "paint" on it. The user can choose the paint color using the Mixed Reality Toolkit colorpicker.
